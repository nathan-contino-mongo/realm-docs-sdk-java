io.realm.RealmMigration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _io_realm_RealmMigration:

*Superclass:*



The RealmMigration class is used to perform the migration of one Realm schema to another. The schema for a Realm is defined by all classes in a project that extend :ref:`io.realm.RealmObject <io_realm_RealmObject>` or implement :ref:`io.realm.RealmModel <io_realm_RealmModel>`, so any changes to these classes will require a migration.

To support migrations from any previous schemaVersion to the newest, the following pattern is recommended when writing a migration:

 

.. code-block:: java

   
    public class CustomMigration implements RealmMigration {
      \@Override
      public long migrate(DynamicRealm realm, long oldVersion, long newVersion) {
        RealmSchema schema = realm.getSchema();
   
        if (oldVersion == 0) {
          // Migrate from v0 to v1
          oldVersion++;
        }
   
        if (oldVersion == 1) {
          // Migrate from v1 to v2
          oldVersion++;
        }
   
        if (oldVersion < newVersion) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(String.format(Locale.US, "Migration missing from v%d to v%d", oldVersion, newVersion));
        }
      }
    }
    


 

During development when RealmObject classes can change frequently, it is possible to use :ref:`io.realm.Realm#deleteRealm(RealmConfiguration) <io_realm_Realm_deleteRealm_RealmConfiguration_>`. This will delete the database file and eliminate the need for any migrations.
