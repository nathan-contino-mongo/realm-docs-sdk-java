Annotation Type Keep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _io_realm_internal_Keep:



io.realm.internal
=================

*Implemented interfaces:*



- `java.lang.annotation.Annotation <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Annotation.html>`__ 


This annotation is used to mark the classes to be kept by ProGuard/DexGuard. The ProGuard configuration must have '-keep class io.realm.internal.Keep' and '-keep,includedescriptorclasses @io.realm.internal.Keep class * { *; }'.NOTE: The outer class and the inner class have to be both annotated by this if they need to be kept.
