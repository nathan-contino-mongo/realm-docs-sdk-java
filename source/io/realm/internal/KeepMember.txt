*Implemented interfaces:*



- `java.lang.annotation.Annotation <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Annotation.html>`__ 


This annotation is used to mark the fields and methods to be kept by ProGuard/DexGuard. The ProGuard configuration must have '-keep class io.realm.internal.KeepMember' and '-keep,includedescriptorclasses @io.realm.internal.KeepMember class * { @io.realm.internal.KeepMember *; }'. This annotation must be added to class as well to work.
