io.realm.RealmChangeListener<T>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _io_realm_RealmChangeListener:

RealmChangeListener can be registered with a **Realm (?)**, **RealmResults (?)**or **RealmObject (?)**to receive a notification about updates.

When registered against a ``Realm``you'll get notified when a Realm instance has been updated. Register against a ``RealmResults``, ``RealmList``, ``RealmDictionary``or ``RealmObject``to only get notified about changes to them.



Realm instances on a thread without an **android.os.Looper (?)**cannot register a RealmChangeListener.



All **io.realm.RealmObject (?)**and **io.realm.RealmResults (?)**will automatically contain their new values when the **#onChange(Object) (?)**method is called. Normally this means that it isn't necessary to query again for those objects, but just invalidate any UI elements that are using them. If there is a chance that a object has been been deleted, it can be verified by using **RealmObject#isValid() (?)**.
