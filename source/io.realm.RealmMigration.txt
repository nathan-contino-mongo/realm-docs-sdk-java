io.realm.RealmMigration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _io_realm_RealmMigration:

The RealmMigration class is used to perform the migration of one Realm schema to another. The schema for a Realm is defined by all classes in a project that extend **io.realm.RealmObject (?)**or implement **io.realm.RealmModel (?)**, so any changes to these classes will require a migration.

To support migrations from any previous schemaVersion to the newest, the following pattern is recommended when writing a migration:



.. code-block:: java

   
    public class CustomMigration implements RealmMigration {
      \@Override
      public long migrate(DynamicRealm realm, long oldVersion, long newVersion) {
        RealmSchema schema = realm.getSchema();
   
        if (oldVersion == 0) {
          // Migrate from v0 to v1
          oldVersion++;
        }
   
        if (oldVersion == 1) {
          // Migrate from v1 to v2
          oldVersion++;
        }
   
        if (oldVersion < newVersion) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(String.format(Locale.US, "Migration missing from v%d to v%d", oldVersion, newVersion));
        }
      }
    }
    



During development when RealmObject classes can change frequently, it is possible to use **io.realm.Realm#deleteRealm(RealmConfiguration) (?)**. This will delete the database file and eliminate the need for any migrations.

-----------

public **void (?)** migrate (:ref:`DynamicRealm <io_realm_DynamicRealm>` realm, **long (?)** oldVersion, **long (?)** newVersion)

This method will be called if a migration is needed. The entire method is wrapped in a write transaction so it is possible to create, update or delete any existing objects without wrapping it in your own transaction.
Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

- ``realm - ``the Realm schema on which to perform the migration.
   
- ``oldVersion - ``the schema version of the Realm at the start of the migration.
   
- ``newVersion - ``the schema version of the Realm after executing the migration.
