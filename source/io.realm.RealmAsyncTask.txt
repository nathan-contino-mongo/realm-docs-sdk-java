io.realm.RealmAsyncTask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _io_realm_RealmAsyncTask:

Represents a pending asynchronous Realm task, like asynchronous transactions.Users are responsible for maintaining a reference to ``RealmAsyncTask``in order to call **#cancel() (?)**in case of a configuration change for example (to avoid memory leak, as the transaction will post the result to the caller's thread callback).
